## Description

A ray tracing engine designed to render a static scene containing a number of cylinders, spheres and planes, with or without intersections, and shading based on brightness of ambient and light source.\
\
Ray tracing is a technique used to generate realistic images by tracing the path of rays of light as they travel through a scene.\
\
Light reflection and refraction must be simulated, as well as diffuse light.
